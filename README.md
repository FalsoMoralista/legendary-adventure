## Description
 This repository was initially created to **aggregate the content** about **neural networks** learned by me. Later on i decided to try to organize it by **documentating & anexing** the **resources** that **i am using to learn** so that **others** that wants to **get started** can **easily** do it **independely** *starting through here*.

## Data
  - All the data that we will be using in the experiments will be placed in the [data](/data) section. Description and additional resources are shown below.
    - The [breast-cancer](data/breast) diagnostic dataset, containing features from digitalized cell images and its respectively classification. See original [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).
    - The [iris](data/iris) dataset, containing data from 150 plants of 3 different classes. Original [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).
    - The [autos](data/autos) dataset, containing  data from 370.000 used cars from Ebay Kleinanzeigen. Original can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database)
    - The [barcelona](data/barcelona-data-sets) datasets, containing: Administration, Urban environment, Population, Territory, Economy and Business datasets from the city of Barcelona. Original [link](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/barcelona-data-sets).
