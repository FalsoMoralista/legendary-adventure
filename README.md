## Description
 This repository was initially created to **aggregate the content** about **neural networks** learned by me. Later on i decided to try to organize it by **documentating & anexing** the **resources** that **i am using to learn** so that **others** that wants to **get started** can **easily** do it **independely** *starting through here*.
